# Neural Chromium

The Agentic Web Runtime.

This repository is maintained by Senti-001.

## Project Overview

Neural Chromium is a **custom fork of the Chromium web browser**, designed from the ground up to serve as a high-performance, secure, and machine-native operating environment for AI agents. Rather than a separate browser, it's an **overlay of critical modifications and integrations** on top of the robust Chromium core.

Our mission is to enable AI agents to interact with the digital world with human-parity perception, zero-trust security, and autonomous economic capabilities.

## Development Log & Milestones

### February 17, 2026 - Infrastructure Rebirth (GCP)
*   **GCP Industrial Builder Live**: Successfully transitioned the main build environment from legacy AWS to a high-performance **GCP** node (`senti-big-iron-gcp`) at **136.113.105.70**.
*   **Zero-Copy Vision Stabilized**: The ZCV architecture (NC-OPS-012) has been fully integrated and verified on the new GCP-hosted 'Big Iron'.
*   **Industrial Tooling**: Node is provisioned with `git`, `docker`, and `depot_tools` for continuous agentic build cycles.

### February 10, 2026 - Initial Setup & Core Access
*   **Repository Initialization**: The `neural-chromium` repository was created.
*   **AWS Alpha Phase**: Initial builds and CDP handshake tests performed on legacy AWS infrastructure (Now Decommissioned).

## Key Architectural Principles

*   **Zero-Copy Vision (ZCV)**: Direct integration with Chromium's compositor (Viz) for real-time visual perception.
*   **Semantic Understanding**: native UCP semantic awareness via the AXTree.
*   **Zero-Trust Networking**: Secure identity-based trust (mTLS/Noise Protocol).
*   **Hardware Isolation**: Hypervisor-grade isolation (MicroVMs/gVisor).
